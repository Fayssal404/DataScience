# Use a genetic algorithm to simulate a population of rats with an average weight of 110 pounds from an initial population weighting. 

Pseudo-code like:
    - Establish initial population and range of weights
    - Evaluate fitness by comparing mean population weight to a target weight 
    - Eliminates smalles males and females (send to Austin Powers evil petting zoo)
    - Repopulate with random weights based on weight rang of the selected rats (Mate and breed the remaining rats - crossover)
    - Randomly alter weights on a few rats. Most outcomes reduces weight
