## Pros & Cons

### Pros
 - Does not require the specification of a function to fit a model to all of the data in the sample
 - Very flexible, making it ideal for modeling complex processes for which no theoretical models exist
 - Many other tests and procedures used for validation of least squares models can also be extended to LOESS models
 
### Cons
 - Makes less efficient use of data than other least squares methods
 - Requires fairly large, densely sampled data sets in order to produce good models
 - LOESS provides less complex data analysis in exchange for greater experimental costs
 - Does not produce a regression function that is easily represented by a mathematical formula
 - Computationally intensive method
 - Prone to the effects of outliers in the data set
