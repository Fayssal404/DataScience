In order to estimate the area of intersection between two circles, random points are generated in the rectangle surrounding the circles.
Based on the ratio of the points inside the intersection, we get an approximation of the area ratio with respect to the rectangular area.


## Information
It is possible at this point to estimate the area of intersection between two circles enclosed in a rectangle.
Another possibility to improve the application might be more shapes to enclose the circles.
In addition, it is possible to estimate the intersection of several circles.
